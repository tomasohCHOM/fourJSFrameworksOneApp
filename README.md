# fourJSFrameworksOneApp

Creating a simple Single-Page Web Application, using FOUR different JavaScript Frameworks. Those being: React, Angular, Vue, and Svelte. Here are my thoughts about each framework:

## React
|Positives|Negatives|
|:-------:|:-------:|
|Most popular and resourceful UI libary|Class vs Functional Components|
|Minimal and unopinionated (could be considered a negative as well tbh)|Need to learn hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef...)|
|Flexible and intuitive with basic knowledge of have JavaScript works|Lack of extra tooling in the template. Everything is conditionally rendered through pure JS (array methods, ternary)|

## Angular
|Positives|Negatives|
|:-------:|:-------:|
|Robust and highly scalable architecture|Verbose/boilerplate-y for smaller-scale projects|
|Most powerful cli with `ng` commands|Learning curve understanding modules and classes to create components|
|First and third-party libraries support out of the box|Large bundle sizes and slow builds|

## Vue
|Positives|Negatives|
|:-------:|:-------:|
|Combine all three elements (HTML, CSS, JS) in one single file|Option vs Composition API (divergent opinions)|
|Provides helper directives to manage conditional and iterable template rendering|Slightly smaller community support than like React|
|Flexible and lightweight|Lacking in the mobile-development industry|

## Svelte
|Positives|Negatives|
|:-------:|:-------:|
|Combine all three elements (HTML, CSS, JS) in one single file|Still not highly adopted by companies/enterprises|
|Simple and easy to approach|Created abstractions for writing "reactive" JS|
|Compiled, providing additional template for conditional/iterable rendering|Smaller community support (though, loved by their users!)|

Probably missing many more important points about each framework, but those were the ones to come to mind. I highly encourage trying different things yourself as well. Thanks for reading!
