# fourJSFrameworksOneApp

Creating a simple Single-Page Web Application, using FOUR different JavaScript Frameworks. Those being: React, Angular, Vue, and Svelte. Currently a WIP, but as soon as I finish working on these, I will update this README to provide my opinion on each of these frameworks, how they compare in terms of DX, and overall whether they are an appealing choice to build your next application! (BTW what I am building is a bare-bones mockup of my portfolio website).
